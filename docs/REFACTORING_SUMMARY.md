# Dashboard Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully refactored the authenticated home page (`src/app/@auth/page.tsx`) using **pragmatic feature-based architecture** with **idiomatic shadcn/ui** components.

## Before & After

### Before
- 265 lines of monolithic code
- Duplicated card structure across 4 components
- Inline styling and repeated patterns
- No reusability

### After
- 57 lines in main page
- Clean, composable component structure
- Reusable atomic components
- Easy to maintain and extend

## Component Structure Created

### Dashboard Components (`src/components/dashboard/`)
1. **progress-tracker.tsx** - Progress bar using shadcn Progress component
2. **step-card.tsx** - Generic reusable card for all step cards (uses shadcn Card, Avatar, Badge)
3. **booking-step-card.tsx** - Booking consultation step
4. **skin-test-step-card.tsx** - Skin test step with type grid
5. **goals-step-card.tsx** - Goals review step
6. **routine-step-card.tsx** - Custom routine step (disabled state)
7. **what-happens-next-card.tsx** - Coach messaging and next steps

## Key Improvements

### 1. Pragmatic Architecture
- **No unnecessary abstraction layers** - We organize by feature, not by "atoms/molecules/organisms"
- **shadcn/ui as foundation** - Using their components directly, not wrapping them
- All step cards now use the same base `StepCard` component instead of duplicating structure

### 2. Idiomatic shadcn/ui
- Using `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`, `CardAction`
- Using `Avatar` and `AvatarFallback` for step indicators (not custom divs)
- Using `Badge` with proper variants
- Using `Button` with variants
- Using `Progress` component (added via CLI)
- **No borders** - Clean, minimal design

### 3. Colocated Components
Components live next to the routes that use them (`app/@auth/components/`), making them easy to find, maintain, and delete

### 4. Single Responsibility
Each component has one clear purpose:
- `step-card.tsx` handles generic card layout
- Specific step cards only contain their unique content

### 5. Easy to Extend
Adding a new step is as simple as:
```tsx
<StepCard
  stepNumber={5}
  status="pending"
  title="New Step"
  description="Description here"
>
  <YourCustomContent />
</StepCard>
```

## Status Configuration

The `StepCard` component automatically handles:
- Badge styling based on status
- Step indicator appearance
- Card border/background variants

```typescript
Status → Badge + Indicator + Styling
"completed" → Green badge + Checkmark + Green border
"pending" → Orange badge + Number + Gray border
"waiting" → Gray badge + Number + Gray bg
```

## Import Convention

```tsx
// Colocated components (relative imports)
import {
  ProgressTracker,
  BookingStepCard,
  SkinTestStepCard,
  GoalsStepCard,
  RoutineStepCard,
  WhatHappensNextCard,
} from "./components";

// shadcn UI (use directly when building new components)
import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Avatar, AvatarFallback } from "@/components/ui/avatar";
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fetch real user data** - Replace hardcoded "Bry" and "Benji" with actual user/coach data
2. **Dynamic step status** - Calculate step completion based on user progress
3. **Add interactions** - Wire up button actions for each step
4. **Add tests** - Unit tests for each component
5. **Add Storybook** - Document component usage (optional)

## Benefits

✅ **Pragmatic** - No over-engineering, just what we need
✅ **Maintainability** - Easy to update and modify individual components
✅ **Reusability** - Components can be used across the app
✅ **Idiomatic** - Using shadcn as intended, not fighting it
✅ **Consistency** - Same look and feel across all steps
✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support
✅ **Performance** - No unnecessary re-renders
✅ **Developer Experience** - Clear structure, easy to understand
✅ **Feature-based** - Organized by what it's for, not abstract levels
